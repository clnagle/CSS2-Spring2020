### Course description
This course explores the use of computational methods across the social sciences. Topics include thinking like a computational social scientist; research design for big data; legal and ethical dimensions of Computational Social Science (CSS). Students will implement demonstrations of these methods in Python through data visualization, selection, and modeling. 

### Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of how to visualize, clean, and organize data for data analysis and modeling. Throughout the course, we will utilize NumPy and Pandas and will cover Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit packages as well, which all commonly used in data science. By the end of the course, you will be able to do basic data science from a variety of data sources. 

### Class time
Each lecture will consist of coding via Python and you are encouraged to follow along. In sections you will cover problem sets that reinforce the topics covered in lecture.
The initial plan is that each lecture will take place during regular course time over Zoom. The lectures are non-mandatory and will be recorded and uploaded online for you to access throughout the semester.

### Material and Textbook
Lecture material (videos and code sheets) will be provided on Canvas and on: 
https://github.com/garrettswan/CSS2-Spring2020

There is no required textbook for this course. However, there are many intro books out there that you might find helpful, such as “Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython” by Wes McKinney and “Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data” by Jake VanderPlas 

## Exams

### Short Quizzes
Starting week 2: At the start of section there will be a short quiz with questions focused on topics from class (approx. 5-10 multiple-choice questions). These quizzes will be given online using google forms.
Each of the quizzes will be worth 5 points.
You can drop two quizzes to give you some flexibility if you need to be late for a class or if you have other obligations that prevent you from preparing (best 7/9 quizzes for 35 total points).

### Midterm
There will be a midterm that will cover material from the first 1/2 of the class. The midterm will be worth 50 points.

### Final Project
Instead of a final exam you will have a final project that will require you to generate code to perform basic data science on a unique dataset. More details will be provided during 2nd week. The final project will be worth 50 points.

### In-section problem sets
Starting week 2 there will be a problem set that you will work on in section and out of class. These assignments are meant to give you the hands-on practice that you need to develop fluency in the language. You must complete 7/9 problem sets (drop the two lowest scores). The problem sets will be graded weekly and will count for 5 points each (35 total).

### Discussion questions on Canvas
There will be a weekly prompt (starting week 2) on Canvas whereby you submit and respond on the Canvas discussion board. Per prompt, you will need to submit a post and respond to a post. In total, this will be worth 10 points. To give you some flexibility, you will receive the full 10 points if you complete 80% of the prompts.

### General debugging advice
Like learning any skill, practice makes perfect. Fortunately, programming is really good at letting you know when you’ve done something wrong! When that happens, try the following steps in this order:
1.	Double check the spelling/syntax
2.	Print and check the variables
3.	If it’s a function or operation, check the help menu to see that you are using the correct syntax
4.	Create a new workbook, copy and paste the variables and code specifically related to the error, then try it
5.	If the error is still occurring, try googling the error message
6.	If there is no obvious solution on google, try rewording the problem you are having
7.	If the problem is still occurring, email your TA
8.	If the problem is still occurring, contact your instructor
Learning how to debug is an important part of programming and critical when dealing with long scripts. I encourage each of you to try debugging your errors before asking for the solution!

### Missed exams
No makeup exams will be given unless (1) notice is given to the instructor by 5 p.m. the day before the exam, AND (2) extenuating circumstances prevail for which documentation is available, in the form of an airline ticket receipt, funeral notice, etc. (in the case of family emergencies) or a doctor’s note (not an appointment card) for serious illness/injury. This documentation must be presented to the instructor, not merely offered. All makeup exams must be taken within one week of the missed exam.

### Letter grade in course
Grades will be based on the percentage of points earned on the midterm, final project, attendance/participation, and problem sets.
Letter grades will be assigned based on the following table:
A+ 97-100
A 93-96.99999
A- 90-92.99999
B+ 87-89.99999
B 83-86.99999
B- 80-82.99999
C+ 77-79.99999
C 73-76.99999
C- 70-72.99999
D+ 67-69.99999
D 63-66.99999
D- 60-62.99999
F 0-59.99999
Grades will not be rounded.

### Academic Integrity
From UCSD Academic Integrity office
"Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."

Please read the full UCSD policy

This course will also make use of online quizzes and exams via Google Forms. This means that each of you will be sent an email and will take quizzes/exams online with your user_name@ucsd.edu email linked to your grade. Taking a quiz or exam logged in as another student will be treated as a violation and you will be referred for disciplinary action. Similarly, emailing with or otherwise communicating with other students or anyone else during a quiz or exam will be treated as a violation and also referred for disciplinary action.

### Class Conduct
I expect respect and consideration for both your classmates and myself. Please contact me if you feel as if any problems arise were you feel as if the classroom is no longer an exclusive environment.

### Changes to Syllabus
Changes may have to be made to the syllabus and/or schedule. Any changes will be posted online and announced in class.
